- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting an education in front end development!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more JavaScript

- âš¡ Fun fact: The Universe's average colour is called 'Cosmic latte'. In a 2002 [study](https://www.sciencefocus.com/space/universe-average-colour-cosmic-latte), astronomers found that the light coming from galaxies averaged into a beige colour thatâ€™s close to white. And I don't like that one bit.
